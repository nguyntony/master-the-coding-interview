# Master the Coding Interview
👋🏼 Hello world! 
This is an educational repo for myself, the contents within this repo will mainly follow Andrei Neagoie’s [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/). Any other resources will be posted. 

Why am I publishing this to a public repo? I have a deep passion for learning and hopefully I can use that passion to make meaningful connections but more importantly help a fellow developer! 🌱✊🏼
